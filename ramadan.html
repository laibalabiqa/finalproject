created plans to expand our surgical oncology services for breast cancer,open two new operating rooms,& expand our diagnostic capabilities in pulmonology.In<br>
Karachi,we opened a Walk-in Clinic for screening & triaging & began finishing works for our third & largest hospital.<br><br>
Even in these challenging economics times,we know you have always supported those who are less fortunate.As such,we request your generous donations &<br>
zakat to help continue giving hope to people with cancer.<br><br>

Decades before becoming a philanthropist,our founder IMRAN KHAN was a celebrated cricket icon who achived a historic victory when he led the Pakistan team to<br>
with the 1992 Cricket World Cup.He donated his prize money,as well as additional funds,to establish Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in Lahore 1994.<br>
This was the first cancer hospital in Pakistan & the start of Imran's long-standing commitment to charity.<br><br><br>
Oral cancer is one of the highest in the world in Karachi,and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract is also increasing in the population.Our new hospital will offer<br>
specialist care & treatment to those living with these & other cancers in the region.<br><br><br>
Karachi is the capital of the sindh province of Pakistan's largest.most populated city.Poverty is the major issue in this area with over 40% of the population living on<br>
less then 80 pence a day & 75% of those living in rural neighbourhoods nearby facing smilar levels of deprrivation.In these deperate time,crime is rampant &<br>
human life has little value;it is not uncommon for parents to abandon their children & for the sick to have little hope for survival.Our new hospital with offer free,<br>
high-quality treatment to the poorest cancer patients & bring renewed hope to those in deperate need.<br><br><br>
We remain grateful for your ongoing support in helping us reach even more construction milestones this years.

    <h2>GIVE SADAQAH JARIYAH TO OUR KARACHI HOSPITAL</h2>
    <div class="para3">
        "When a man dies,his good deeds come to an end expect for three things:Sadaqah Jariyah [ceasless charity];a knowledge which[he has passed on &]is<br>
        beneficial;or a virtous descendant who prays for him."(Muslim)
    </div>
    <div class="para4">
        <br>
        Giving Sadaqah jariyah to a hospital that provides healing is an excellent way to reap the benefits of our charity in his life & in the hereafter.<br>
        <br>Many of us can't afford to give much this Ramadan.That's why we're coming toghether to give what we can towards a big cause with perpetual blessings.<br><br>
